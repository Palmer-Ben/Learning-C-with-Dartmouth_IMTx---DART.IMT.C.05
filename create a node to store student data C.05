You would like to store student data (for each student, their name and age) in a linked list of students. You are given the following structure to store each student's information.

Your first task is to write a function createStudent() that takes as inputs a string (namely a student's name) and an integer (their age) and that returns a pointer to a struct student which stores this information. Your function should dynamically allocate the memory required for this struct student and then write the student's name and age into this newly allocated memory. 

Strucutre, prototypes, and main are given


#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

struct student {
      char name[50];
      int age;
      struct student *next;
};

struct student *createStudent(char studentName[], int studentAge);

// Write other function prototypes here (if any)

int main(void) {
    struct student *studptr;
    int myAge;
    char myName[50];
    scanf("%s %d", myName, &myAge);
    studptr = createStudent(myName, myAge);
    printf("New student created: %s is %d years old.\n", studptr->name, studptr->age);
    free(studptr);
    return 0;
}

// Write your createStudent function here (and any other functions you see fit)

struct student *createStudent(char studentName[], int studentAge){
    
    //store struct student pointer
    struct student *ptr;
    
    //Allocate memory
    ptr = (struct student *) malloc(sizeof(struct student));
    
    // loop var
    int i = 0;
    
    //loop thorugh student name to search for null character
    while(studentName[i] != '\0'){
        ptr->name[i] = studentName[i];
        i++;
    }
    
    //put approprite items in age
    ptr->age = studentAge;
    ptr->next = NULL;
    
    //return ptr
    return(ptr);
}
